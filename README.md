# Text Document Inverted Index

This Python script demonstrates the creation and usage of an inverted index for a collection of text documents. An inverted index is a data structure commonly used in information retrieval systems to efficiently store and retrieve text-based information.

## Features

- Efficiently creates an inverted index from a collection of text documents.
- Supports querying for documents containing specific words.
- Performs text preprocessing, including tokenization, punctuation removal, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- Uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for text processing tasks.
